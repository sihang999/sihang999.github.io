<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
Hi, welcome to my personal website!

I am an aspiring student with a solid foundation in circuit design, and I am continuously expanding my skill set by learning programming languages such as Python, C, and JavaScript.

I am a fast learner, passionate about new technologies, and always eager to enhance my skills through continuous learning and hands-on projects.

If you have any exciting projects or opportunities related to IC layout, circuit design, simulation & verification, embedded engineering, web application development with LLMs, feel free to reach out — I would love to connect and explore how I can contribute!
