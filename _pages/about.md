Hello! I am Sihang Wu, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Communication and Electronics Engineering at the Technical University of Munich. My academic journey began with a dual Bachelor's background in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Zhengzhou University and Duisburg-Essen University, where I built a strong foundation in digital systems and circuit design.

Professionally, I have diverse experiences in hardware and software development. At Dejet, I worked as a test engineer ensuring the functionality and energy efficiency of smartphones. Later, at Huawei, I contributed as a software developer, automating workflows using Python and collaborating on projects utilizing Git and Docker. My academic projects reflect my passion for problem-solving, including implementing encryption algorithms on FPGA boards and using embedded systems for vehicle condition monitoring.

Fluent in English, German, and my native Chinese, I am passionate about combining technical expertise with continuous learning. With a keen interest in FPGA design, digital circuits, and SoC technologies, I aim to make meaningful contributions to advancing electronic systems.
