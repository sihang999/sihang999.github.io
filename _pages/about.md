Hi, welcome to my personal website. I am an aspiring student with a strong foundation in integrated circuit, spanning both analog and digital domains. 

Currently, I am deepening my understanding of analog IC design, simulation, and verification in the Chair of Circuit Design at TUM, and I am also actively seeking any opportunity to engage in analog IC tasks to further strengthen my expertise.

I am a fast learner, always curious about new technologies, and dedicated to improving my skills through continuous learning and hands-on practice. If you have any exciting projects or opportunities related to analog IC design, simulation and verification, I would love to connect and contribute!
