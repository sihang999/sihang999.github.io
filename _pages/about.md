<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
Hello! I’m Sihang Wu, a master's student at TUM. No matter the past, present, or future, I always stay positive about my life. I am also open to new experiences and challenges because I believe that growth only happens when you step out of your comfort zone.

IF you want to know more about me, there is a [CV website](https://sihang999.github.io/cv/) where you can browse and download my CV. Another option is that you can talk with my Assitant Robot ["Sihang chat"](https://sihang999.github.io/SihangChat/)!
